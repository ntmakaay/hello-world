# hello-world
Basic repository for self-learning

Hello, my name's Dat. I'm 23 years old. I have just graduated from Bach Khoa HCM university in Aerospace Engineering.
I'm doing a project about Fuzzy logic control algorithm for hexacopter.
This is my first repository to get an overview on Github.
Hope that I could master this soon.
